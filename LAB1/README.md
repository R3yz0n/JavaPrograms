```
OOP in Java ( Lab 1 )
```
Objective: To learn about the basics of Java and create the hello world program in Java.
Descriptions:

- See the theory in the slides that is provided in the class
Program
Note: The program should be well formatted i.e. proper use of indentation, comment, description
of program and functions etc.

1. Write a program "TenHellowWorlds.java" and then prints "Hello, Wrold" ten times.

3. Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omit
- main  ```// the file is not runnable```
- String ```  // the file is not runnable ```
- HelloWorld ``` // the file is not runnable ```
- System.out ``` // cannot find symbol | Symbol: method out```
- println ``` // cannot find symbol | Symbol: method println```

3. Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omit
- the ; ``` // ';' expected```
- the first " ``` // ')' expected```
- the second " ``` // unclosed string literal```
- the first { ``` // '{' expected```
- the second { ``` // ';' expected```
- the first } ``` // reached end of file (EOF) while parsing```
- the second } ``` // reached EOF while parsing```

4. Run the following program and what error message you've got? Solve the problem.

```
public class Hello {
  public static void main() {
    System.out.println("Doesn't execute");
  }
}
```

// The above program is solved by adding  ```(String[] args)```
